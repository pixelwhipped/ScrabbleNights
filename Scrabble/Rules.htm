            The Scrabble Board</h2>
        <p>
            A Scrabble game board is made of up cells in a square grid. The Scrabble board 
            is 15 cells wide by 15 cells high. The Scrabble tiles fit within these cells one 
            to a cell.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Scrabble Tiles
        </h2>
        <p>
            Scrabble is played with exactly 100 tiles. 98 of these tiles contain letters on 
            them, while there are 2 blank tiles. These blank tiles add a wildcard aspect to 
            Scrabble. The blanks substitute for any letter in the alphabet. Once played, a 
            blank tile remains for the remainder of the game the letter for which it was 
            substituted when first played.
        </p>
        <p>
            Various letters have different point values, depending on the rarity of the 
            letter and the difficulty in playing it. Blank tiles have no point value.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Tile Values</h2>
        <p>
            Here are the point values for each letter in Scrabble.
        </p>
        <p>
            0 Points - Blank tile.</p>
        <p>
            1 Point - A, E, I, L, N, O, R, S, T and U.
        </p>
        <p>
            2 Points - D and G.</p>
        <p>
            3 Points - B, C, M and P.
        </p>
        <p>
            4 Points - F, H, V, W and Y.
        </p>
        <p>
            5 Points - K.
        </p>
        <p>
            8 Points - J and X.
        </p>
        <p>
            10 Points - Q and Z.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Extra Point Values</h2>
        <p>
            Some squares on the Scrabble board represent multipliers. If a tile is placed on 
            this square, then the tile&#39;s value is multiplied by a factor or either 2x or 3x. 
            Certain tiles multiply the point value of an entire word and not simply the tile 
            on that space.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Double Letter Scores</b> - Light blue cells are found isolated on the board. 
            When a tile is placed on this space, that tile&#39;s point value is multiplied by 
            two.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Triple Letter Score</b> - This is a dark blue cell on the Scrabble. The tile 
            placed on this square has its points multiplied by three.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Double Word Score</b> - Light red cells are found running diagonally towards 
            the four corners of the board. When a player plays a word on one of these 
            squares, the point value of the entire word is multiplied by two.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Triple Word Score</b> - This is a dark red square on the Scrabble board. 
            These are found on the four sides of the board equidistant from the four corners 
            of the board. When a word is played using this square, then the points for the 
            word are multiplied by three.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>One Single Use</b> - Note that extra point squares are only usable once. If 
            one player plays a word using this cells, then the next time that space is used 
            to make a word, the point value is not multiplied.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Starting the Game
        </h2>
        <p>
            Without looking into the tile bag, each of the Scrabble players takes one tile 
            out of the tile bag. Whichever player has the letter closest to the beginning of 
            the alphabet goes first. A blank tile is considered better than an &quot;A&quot;. These 
            tiles are placed into the bag once more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting the game, each player begins their turn by drawing seven tiles apiece 
            from the bag. The player can do one of three things on a turn. The player can 
            place a word, exchange tiles or pass. Most of the time, the player will take the 
            option of playing a word.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exchanging tiles allows a player to replace anywhere between one and all of the 
            tiles on the player&#39;s rack. If this option is taken, the player cannot do 
            anything else that hand. Therefore, a tile exchange cannot be performed on a 
            turn when the player places a word on the board.
        </p>
        <p>
            A player may pass at any time. If all player&#39;s pass twice in a row, then the 
            game ends.
        </p>
        <h2>
            The First Word Score</h2>
        <p>
            A player begins the game by placing a word on the star square at the center of 
            the board. This star acts as a double word score. The star cell does not act as 
            a double word score for subsequent players playing off the center square.
        </p>
        <p>
            Play continues in a clockwise direction around the Scrabble board.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Replacing Scrabble Tiles</h2>
        <p>
            When a player places tiles on the Scrabble board, that player draws new tiles 
            from the tile bag, adding until that player&#39;s number of tiles equals seven. The 
            player must not look at the tiles when choosing new ones. Tile selection is 
            usually done by holding the bag above the eye line, then reaching into the bag 
            to add tiles one by one.</p>
        <h2>
            The Fifty Point Bonus</h2>
        <p>
            When a player is able to place all seven tiles from the tile rack on the board 
            at the same time, that player receives a 50 point bonus. In end game scenarios, 
            when the players hold less than the standard seven tiles, a player does not get 
            the 50 point bonus for using all the tiles on the rack.
        </p>
        <h2>
            The End of a Scrabble Game</h2>
        <p>
            When all of the tiles have been taken from the bag and one player has used all 
            of the tiles on their rack, then the game ends.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Tallying Scrabble Scores</h2>
        <p>
            Once the game has ended, each player counts the points on the tiles left 
            remaining in their rack. Each player has that number deducted from their final 
            score.
        </p>
        <p>
            The player who ended the game and who therefore has no more tiles remaining is 
            given an added bonus. Add the total of all points of all remaining players with 
            tiles left on their racks. This number is added to the final score of the player 
            who is &quot;out&quot; of tiles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Scrabble player with the highest score after all final scores are tallied 
            wins.
